Customer acquisition costs in SaaS markets can be high due to many similar solutions.
Subscription-based products require long-term customer retention to be profitable.

[EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY STARTUPS]
Education-focused startups often face slow adoption due to budget constraints and institutional decision-making.

AI healthcare solutions often require human oversight to avoid legal and ethical risks.
Deploying AI in healthcare may involve higher operational and compliance costs.
